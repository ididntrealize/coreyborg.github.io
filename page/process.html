                    <p>
                        Start writing as much as you can without deleting anything.
                        Get as much of your story together into a single document as you can.
                        The easiest way to know what pages you'll need is to get everything together, then divide it up.
                        To brainstorm ideas of what to write, start by listing as many related keywords to your idea as
                        you
                        can.
                        You'll need this list later for SEO, so keep it somewhere you can find it.

                        It's important to keep in mind a specific goal for what you want people to do once they come to
                        the
                        site.
                        Each page will be designed to give users the information they need in order to make a choice
                        involving your site.
                        Your site should present viewers with the choice you want them to make once they have been well
                        informed.
                        Some common choices for users to make are:

                    <ul>

                    <p>
                        Each page on your site will need a mix of pictures and text in order to be enticing.
                        Find photos that help prove the information you are providing your viewers.
                        Start saving them into the same folder where you have prepared text for your pages.
                        Once you've collected many images, it will be easier to pair them with text.
                        If you want to process the images yourself, you will need to resize and optimize each image.

                    <em id="site-layouts">How to prepare a site layout</em>
                    <p>
                        Once you have an idea for the amount of content to display and the possible interactions users
                        might
                        make, you should layout your images and text together (either on paper, or in a word document).
                        If you're planning on using a website builder to make your site, you will be able to browse
                        pre-made layouts.
                        If you're building the site from scratch I highly recommend researching similar sites,
                        and taking ideas from their layout (column layout, where they use images, what types of pages
                        they have).
                        It's important not to plagiarize (morally, and google will know), but there's no need to
                        re-invent the wheel.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Keep
                        in mind that all your pages should be designed to obviously offer the choice that you want users
                        to
                        make. If your users don’t make that choice immediately, then you should offer relevant
                        information
                        about why that choice is beneficial, and then give them another opportunity to make that choice.
                        Some examples of a choice you might want users to make:

                        The number of complex terms that are thrown around about web design make it hard to focus in on
                        exactly what is suitable to you.
                        It's easy to get lost in thinking you need something, without really understanding what that
                        thing
                        is.

                        At this point, you need to make a choice of whether to build the site out yourself, or to use a
                        website builder. Using a website builder (like squarespace, wordpress, wix, etc.) is usually
                        what
                        independent businesses choose to do, but it definitely has its trade offs.

                    <em id="site-builder-benefits">The benefits of using a website builder</em>
                    <p>
                        Building a website using a builder is by far the easiest and most convenient option for building
                        a
                        personal or small business website. The process basically consists of choosing a theme (or
                        template), and filling in your pages using the website builder tools. In wordpress, for example,
                        they have an editor that looks like microsoft word - if you can make it in word, you can make it
                        in
                        wordpress. Then, when you want to make updates to your site, it’s fast and convenient.

                    <em id="site-builder-downsides">The tradeoffs of using website builders</em>
                    <p>
                        Using website builders isn’t all peaches and cream. For one, most website builders use a
                        freemium
                        model and know just when they can hook you to pay more. Once you’ve committed to one it’s not
                        easy
                        to switch, and you’ll pay more every month for using their plans. Premium themes cost extra as
                        well,
                        and can have certain features turned off unless you pay. Sites built with website builders tend
                        to
                        be formulaic, and it is likely that you won’t be able to get exactly what you want.


                    </p>

                    <em id="site-builder-and-cms">Using website builders on your own hosting plan</em>
                    <p>
                        There are ways to use a website builder, without needing to pay the company extra! Setting it up yourself can be difficult, but the lasting savings make it worth it.
                        I would highly recommend hiring somebody for a couple hours to install wordpress on your own hosting (or following the guide yourself at wordpress.org - NOT wordpress.com). Then once wordpress is set up,
                        you can access all of the exact same stuff as a site on wordpress.com, without paying premium every month .
                        Website builders which are independent of hosting are usually referred to as Content Management
                        Systems (CMS).
                        Technically, sites like wix and squarespace are also Content Management Systems, but "Website builder" is an easier term for most people to understand.
                        There are a number of great open source Content Management Systems.
                        They take a bit of extra set up at the start,
                        but then you can save money on hosting every month.

                    <p>
                        Sometimes you just need a pixel-perfect unique design for your site as well as a user-friendly
                        way
                        to update it and host blog authors. And who hasn’t, from time to time? This method is the best
                        of
                        both worlds, you can create exactly what you’re envisioning as HTML templates, and then have
                        wordpress fill in any dynamic content (blog posts, the text on web pages, site title, site
                        headline,
                        etc.). I recommend doing this if you are planning any special functionality for your site,
                        beyond
                        just showing people something pretty.

                        Personally, I would be very proud of anybody who took on this task. There’s so much to learn
                        about
                        document formats that you use to tell computers how to visualize your designs. For example, you
                        write an entirely linear file (one word after the next),
                        but the computer needs to know non-linear information, like for example to create two columns on
                        the page.
                        To learn how to write that, you need to learn about HTML and CSS.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Very few people do end up learning about HTML and CSS, though, so that’s why I get paid the big
                        bucks.
                        After learning the basics, there are many tools that can help you create beautiful and
                        interactive designs
                        without having to dive too deep. I recommend looking into Twitter Bootstrap, and jQuery.

                        automagically behind the scenes. For example, your browser looks up the company which registered
                        the domain (A hosting company). That company owns a computer running 24/7 (a server),
                        designated to send your website to anybody who asks.
                        Imagine that you’re putting your website files on a flash drive, but that anybody can connect to
                        your flash drive and see your website. Essentially, hosting your site files is the same as that,
                        only you have to log into your hosting company site and click a couple of buttons (instead of
                        just plugging the drive in).

                        Your hosting company owns the computer which your server is on, you pay hosting companies for
                        maintenance, easy access to make updates to your site, and additional services. Some common
                        tools
                        they offer are:

                    <p>
                        It is possible to get hosting and a website builder for free, although they charge far more for
                        necessary premium features that you only notice once you’ve committed to staying with them. Most
                        of
                        the website builders which have a free option are aggressively geared towards you purchasing
                        their
                        full version. I don't recommend using freemium sites for hosting, because once you've started
                        with
                        their tools, you are less likely to switch (and more likely to pay more). Given that addendum,
                        here
                        are some free hosting options:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>wix.com</li>
                        <li>wordpress.com</li>
                        <li>weebly.com</li>
                    </ul>

                    <em id="free-hosting">Free hosting done right</em>
                    <p>
                        It is possible to host your website for free as well. Some options require that the website is
                        not
                        built with a website builder, like Github Pages. In order to build a website without a website
                        builder,
                        you will have to look into HTML. Other options allow you to use a builder AND still add your own
                        code, like Google Sites. If you are interested in a dynamic website, it can be essential to be
                        able
                        to add your own code to it.

                        If you choose a free hosting solution but want to use your own custom domain name, you will need
                        to
                        do a process called "forwarding". You can call the support line where you bought the domain
                        name,
                        and they can guide you through this process.

                        While your users are evaluating whether to make the choice you want them to make on your site,
                        they
                        should be getting value. You will need to keep their attention long enough for them to arrive at
                        as
                        many calls to action as possible. As your user travels down the page, you should be supplying
                        them
                        with useful information interspersed with calls to action. and a secondary value proposition and
                        call to action. That way, at any point of the funnel, a user is not far from the choice you want
                        them to make. The art of it comes into it trying to find the thin line between not getting in
                        the
                        way of people who know what they want, and pushing your sale on people who need more convincing.

                    <p>
                        It may be tempting to rely on spreading your website by talking to people about it. While it is
                        important to notify your community about updates to your services, you can't rely solely on
                        talking
                        about your website to promote it. In fact, one of the main reasons why people make websites is
                        to
                        remove the need to describe your business to one person at a time. If you are able to personally
                        address your users, I would recommend just doing that. If you’re doing something that people are
                        talking about a lot already, then that can be harnessed with a website. If that’s not already
                        happening for you, don’t count on it starting once you’ve made a website.

                        Search Engine Optimizaiton is the process of making your website more visible to search engines.
                        It's important to note that SEO
                        can’t automatically put you at the top of the search results list, it's more about having a good
                        enough site that search engines don't intentionally ignore your listing. Most of the methods
                        that people use to increase their position aren’t an
                        exact science, because the search engine company is always making changes to find better
                        sites and finding ways to prevent you from cheating it. Search engines are constantly scraping
                        through new
                        websites to find relevant content to provide their users. Some standard practice methods to
                        becoming
                        more available to search engines:

                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Keep people on your site once they get there!</li>
                        <li>Provide content that's accessible to people with disabilities</li>
                        <li>Have other sites link to yours (backlinks)</li>
                        <li>Include Search Engine specific code for page descriptions and images</li>
                    </ul>

                    <em id="paid-advertising">Augmenting your SEO with paid advertising</em>
                    <p>
                        Good placement on search engines is very dependent on if your site is already bonafide (for
                        example,
                        when users don’t try other search results after yours - suggesting they are satisfied with your
                        site). So it can be very important for new sites to artificially place themselves higher in the
                        results before they can become bonafide. For this reason, many new businesses choose to start
                        paid
                        advertisements.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, google ads will let you bid for the top search result. Bids happen every time a
                        user
                        searches for keywords that you designate. You can change your settings to pay more or less,
                        based on
                        how relevant the specific search was to you. You can also set limits on how much you are willing
                        to
                        spend in a day. You have the option to only pay when someone clicks your ad, or or to pay every
                        time your ad is shown.

                    <p>
                        Before purchasing an ad, there are some important marketing exercises to go through. First, try
                        to
                        imagine very specific characteristics of your ideal customer. The old fashioned method is to
                        actually write out the characteristics of a handful of realistic seeming people. If you like,
                        you
                        can create many profiles, and name them and everything. In order to prepare for targeting your
                        ads,
                        try to at least come up with:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What interaction they take with your site (purchase, email list, contact, etc.)</li>
                        <li>Physical location (or more general: city, state, country, etc.)</li>
                        <li>Age (or age range)</li>
                        <li>Interests/hobbies (imagine if you will)</li>
                    </ul>




                    <em id="ad-campaigns">Preparing to purchase your ad</em>
                    <p>
                        Setting up the actual ad (on google ads, for example) is relatively cut and dry. The real
                        finesse
                        comes in by creating the perfect messaging for the perfect person. Even if you’ve already
                        imagined
                        the perfect customer, that raises some important questions:

                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>How many people exist who match my perfect customer? </li>
                        <li>What’s the exact wording that my perfect customer would use?</li>
                        <li>What distinguishes my services (for them) from their other options?</li>
                        <li>As my ad is being shown to people, how can I monitor what works well?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p> My favorite tool for investigating target markets is trends.google.com . You can observe the
                        volume
                        of searches based on location, so you can figure out the best wording for your ad. For example,
                        maybe “cupcake” gets less searches than “muffin”, so your bakery company might want to consider
                        muffin.

                    <em id="ad-auctions">The mechanics behind ad auctions</em>
                    <p>
                        When you create a campaign for your ad, you designate things like when to show the ad and how
                        much
                        you allot to spend on the ad per day. This allows your ad provider to choose an ad whenever a
                        relevant search happens. For example, if multiple people are all buying ads for the keywords
                        “muffin”, “bakery”, and “gingerbread”, then google needs to be able to choose which ad shows
                        when
                        somebody searches for muffin!

                    <em id="incorporating-feedback">Incorporating feedback into further campaigns</em>
                    <p>
                        As your ad campaign progresses, you will be able monitor progress. The Google ads interface has
                        a very user friendly analytics tool to observe your progress. It is paramount to constantly
                        learn from campaigns, and adjust as necessary. You’ll never hit a bullseye on a target you can’t
                        see. It is also important to note you can view ad traffic as separate from normal traffic, so
                        you
                        can see exactly what you’re getting from ad-generated visits to your site.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can also monitor ad traffic from your personal site analytics. The google dashboard is great
                        for observing the user journey to your site, but once the user is on your site, you’ll need your
                        own site analytics to study and learn from their behavior. In google Analytics, you can view ad
                        traffic as separate from normal traffic, so you can see exactly what you’re getting from
                        ad-generated visits to your site. I would recommend following a guide online to set up
                        analytics, or hire me to do it for you!
