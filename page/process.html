                    Start writing as much as you can without deleting anything.
                    Get as much of your story together into a single document as you can.
                    The easiest way to know what pages you'll need is to get everything together, then divide it up.
                    To brainstorm ideas of what to write, start by listing as many related keywords to your idea as you
                    can.
                    You'll need this list later for SEO, so keep it somewhere you can find it.

                <p>
                    It's important to keep in mind a specific goal for what you want people to do once they come to the
                    site.
                    Each page will be designed to give users the information they need in order to make a choice
                    involving your site.
                    Your site should present viewers with the choice you want them to make once they have been well
                    informed.
                    Some common choices for users to make are:
                </p>
                <ul>

                    Each page on your site will need a mix of pictures and text in order to be enticing.
                    Find photos that help prove the information you are providing your viewers.
                    Start saving them into the same folder where you have prepared text for your pages.
                    Once you've collected many images, it will be easier to pair them with text.

                <em>How to prepare a site layout</em>
                <p>
                    Once you have an idea for the amount of content to display and the possible interactions users might
                    make, you should layout your images and text together (either on paper, or in a word document). Keep
                    in mind that all your pages should be designed to obviously offer the choice that you want users to
                    make. If your users don’t make that choice immediately, then you should offer relevant information
                    about why that choice is beneficial, and then give them another opportunity to make that choice.
                    Some examples of a choice you might want users to make:

                </p>

                <p>
                    The number of complex terms that are thrown around about web design make it hard to focus in on
                    exactly what is suitable to you.
                    It's easy to get lost in thinking you need something, without really understanding what that thing
                    is.
                    That's why I've created this guide to creating a website, and what you'll need to do given your
                    initial choices.

                <em>Deciding to use a website builder</em>
                <p>
                    At this point, you need to make a choice of whether to build the site out yourself, or to use a
                    website builder. Using a website builder (like squarespace, wordpress, wix, etc.) is usually what
                    independent businesses choose to do, but it definitely has its trade offs.

                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Squarespace</li>
                    <li>Wordpress</li>
                    <li>Google Sites</li>
                    <li>Wix</li>

                <em>The benefits of using a website builder</em>
                <p>
                    Building a website using a builder is by far the easiest and most convenient option for building a
                    personal or small business website. The process basically consists of choosing a theme (or
                    template), and filling in your pages using the website builder tools. In wordpress, for example,
                    they have an editor that looks like microsoft word - if you can make it in word, you can make it in
                    wordpress. Then, when you want to make updates to your site, it’s fast and convenient.

                <em>The tradeoffs of using website builders</em>
                <p>
                    Using website builders isn’t all peaches and cream. For one, most website builders use a freemium
                    model and know just when they can hook you to pay more. Once you’ve committed to one it’s not easy
                    to switch, and you’ll pay more every month for using their plans. Premium themes cost extra as well,
                    and can have certain features turned off unless you pay. Sites built with website builders tend to
                    be formulaic, and it is likely that you won’t be able to get exactly what you want.

                <em>Getting the most from your website builder</em>
                <p>
                    There are ways to use a website builder, without needing to pay the company extra! However, setting
                    it up yourself can be difficult. I would highly recommend installing wordpress on your own hosting
                    (follow the guide at wordpress.org - NOT wordpress.com). Then once wordpress is set up on your
                    domain, you can access all of the exact same stuff as a site on wordpress.com

                </p>

                <em>Creating custom wordpress themes</em>
                <p>
                    Sometimes you just need a pixel-perfect unique design for your site as well as a user-friendly way
                    to update it and host blog authors. And who hasn’t, from time to time? This method is the best of
                    both worlds, you can create exactly what you’re envisioning as HTML templates, and then have
                    wordpress fill in any dynamic content (blog posts, the text on web pages, site title, site headline,
                    etc.). I recommend doing this if you are planning any special functionality for your site, beyond
                    just showing people something pretty.
                </p>

                <em>Creating your site from scratch</em>
                <p>
                    Personally, I would be very proud of anybody who took on this task. There’s so much to learn about
                    document formats that you use to tell computers how to visualize your designs. For example, you
                    write an entirely linear file, but the computer has to know it is in two columns! To write that
                    linearly, you would need to learn about HTML and CSS.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Very few people do end up learning about it, though, and that’s why I get paid the big bucks.
                    Additionally, there are many tools that can help you create beautiful and interactive designs
                    without having to dive too deep. After gaining a basic understanding of HTML and CSS, I recommend
                    looking into Twitter Bootstrap, and jQuery.

                <em>How servers allow others to see your webpage</em>
                <p>
                    When you type yourdomain.com into a web browser (like Chrome or Safari), a lot of things happen
                    automagically behind the scenes. For example, your browser looks up who owns the company which
                    registered the domain (A hosting company). That company owns a computer running 24/7 (a server),
                    designated to send your website to anybody who asks.

                </p>

                <em>What you pay hosting companies for</em>
                <p>
                    Your hosting company owns the computer which your server is on, you pay hosting companies for
                    maintenance, easy access to make updates to your site, and additional services. Some common tools
                    they offer are:
                </p>
                <ul>

                    <li>A secure way to edit your website files</li>
                    <li>Registering domains</li>

                <em>How to spot freemium traps</em>
                <p>
                    It is possible to get hosting and a website builder for free, although they charge far more for
                    necessary premium features that you only notice once you’ve committed to staying with them. Most of
                    the website builders which have a free option are aggressively geared towards you purchasing their
                    full version. I don't recommend using freemium sites for hosting, because once you've started with
                    their tools, you are less likely to switch (and more likely to pay more). Given that addendum, here
                    are some free hosting options:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>wix.com</li>
                    <li>wordpress.com</li>
                    <li>weebly.com</li>
                </ul>

                <em>Free hosting done right</em>
                <p>
                    It is possible to host your website for free as well. Some options require that the website is not
                    built with a website builder, like Github. In order to build a website without a website builder,
                    you will have to look into HTML. Other options allow you to use a builder AND still add your own
                    code, like Google Sites. If you are interested in a dynamic website, it can be essential to be able
                    to add your own code to it.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Github.com</li>
                    <li>sites.google.com</li>

                <em>Forwarding your domain to your host</em>
                <p>
                    If you choose a free hosting solution but want to use your own custom domain name, you will need to
                    do a process called "forwarding". You can call the support line where you bought the domain name,
                    and they can guide you through this process.

                <em>Inbound marketing to ease users through your funnel</em>
                <p>
                    While your users are evaluating whether to make the choice you want them to make on your site, they
                    should be getting value. You will need to keep their attention long enough for them to arrive at as
                    many calls to action as possible. As your user travels down the page, you should be supplying them
                    with useful information interspersed with calls to action. and a secondary value proposition and
                    call to action. That way, at any point of the funnel, a user is not far from the choice you want
                    them to make. The art of it comes into it trying to find the thin line between not getting in the
                    way of people who know what they want, and pushing your sale on people who need more convincing.

                <em>Relying on more than just word of mouth</em>
                <p>
                    It may be tempting to rely on spreading your website by talking to people about it. While it is
                    important to notify your community about updates to your services, you can't rely solely on talking
                    about your website to promote it. In fact, one of the main reasons why people make websites is to
                    remove the need to describe your business to one person at a time. If you are able to personally
                    address your users, I would recommend just doing that. If you’re doing something that people are
                    talking about a lot already, then that can be harnessed with a website. If that’s not already
                    happening for you, don’t count on it starting once you’ve made a website.

                </p>

                <em>Search Engine Optimizaiton</em>
                <p>
                    SEO is important when a search engine is deciding which websites to display from a search, but it
                    can’t automatically put you at the top of that list. Most of the methods that people use aren’t an
                    exact science, because the search engine company is constantly making changes to find better sites
                    and finding ways to prevent you from cheating it. Search engines are constantly scraping through new
                    websites to find relevant content to provide their users. Some standard practice methods to becoming
                    more available to search engines:

                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Optimize engagement on your site</li>
                    <li>Provide content designed for accessibility concerns</li>
                    <li>Have other sites link to yours (backlinks)</li>
                    <li>Include meta information for all your pages and content</li>
                </ul>

                <em>Augmenting your SEO with paid advertising</em>
                <p>
                    Good placement on search engines is very dependent on if your site is already bonafide (for example,
                    when users don’t try other search results after yours - suggesting they are satisfied with your
                    site). So it can be very important for new sites to artificially place themselves higher in the
                    results before they can become bonafide. For this reason, many new businesses choose to start paid
                    advertisements.

                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, google ads will let you bid for the top search result. Bids happen every time a user
                    searches for keywords that you designate. You can change your settings to pay more or less, based on
                    how relevant the specific search was to you. You can also set limits on how much you are willing to
                    spend in a day. Facebook has an interesting advertising structure as well, allowing you to pay based
                    on how many times your page is shown or how many times someone actually clicks on your ad.
                </p>

                <em>Imagining your ideal customer</em>
                <p>
                    Before purchasing an ad, there are some important marketing exercises to go through. First, try to
                    imagine very specific characteristics of your ideal customer. The old fashioned method is to
                    actually write out the characteristics of a handful of realistic seeming people. If you like, you
                    can create many profiles, and name them and everything. In order to prepare for targeting your ads,
                    try to at least come up with:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What interaction they take with your site (purchase, email list, contact, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Physical location (or more general: city, state, country, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Age (or age range)</li>
                    <li>Interests/hobbies (imagine if you will)</li>
                </ul>




                <em>Preparing to purchase your ad</em>
                <p>
                    Setting up the actual ad (on google ads, for example) is relatively cut and dry. The real finesse
                    comes in by creating the perfect messaging for the perfect person. Even if you’ve already imagined
                    the perfect customer, that raises some important questions:

                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How many people exist who match my perfect customer? </li>
                    <li>What’s the exact wording that my perfect customer would use?</li>
                    <li>What distinguishes my services (for them) from their other options?</li>
                    <li>As my ad is being shown to people, how can I monitor what works well?</li>
                </ul>
                <p> My favorite tool for investigating target markets is trends.google.com . You can observe the volume
                    of searches based on location, so you can figure out the best wording for your ad. For example,
                    maybe “cupcake” gets less searches than “muffin”, so your bakery company might want to consider
                    muffin.
                </p>


                <em>The mechanics behind ad auctions</em>
                <p>
                    When you create a campaign for your ad, you designate things like when to show the ad and how much
                    you allot to spend on the ad per day. This allows your ad provider to choose an ad whenever a
                    relevant search happens. For example, if multiple people are all buying ads for the keywords
                    “muffin”, “bakery”, and “gingerbread”, then google needs to be able to choose which ad shows when
                    somebody searches for muffin!
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can change your campaign settings to budget more or less per ad and per day. You also have the
                    option to pay per click, rather than per visualization.
                </p>

                <em>Incorporating feedback into further campaigns</em>
                <p>
                    As your ad campaign progresses, you will be able monitor progress. It is paramount to constantly
                    learn from campaigns, and adjust as necessary. You’ll never hit a bullseye on a target you can’t
                    see. It is also important to note you can view ad traffic as separate from normal traffic, so you
                    can see exactly what you’re getting from ad-generated visits to your site.
                </p>
